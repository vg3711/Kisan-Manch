OUR IDEA IS AIMED AT PROVIDING REAL TIME SOLUTIONS FOR THE QUERIES AND PROBLEMS PERTAINING TO THE FARMERS CURRENTLY,FARMERS DO NOT HAVE MUCH HELP AVAILABLE WHENEVER THEY HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THEIR CROPS OR LAND.ALTHOUGH IT IS POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO CONSULT WITH THE AGRICULTURAL AUTHORITIES,IT IS GENERALLY TIME CONSUMING AND NOT FEASIBLE FOR THEM. OUR APPLICATION WILL PRIMARILY FOCUS ON SOLVING THIS PROBLEM.WE WILL BE CREATING A DIGITAL COMMUNTIY WHICH WILL HAVE MANY FEATURES LIKE:

1.FARMERS CAN POST THEIR QUERIES AND THESE CAN BE ANSWERED BY EXPERTS.HOWEVER,FELLOW FARMERS CAN ALSO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS.NO SUCH APPLICATION EXISTS TILL DATE THAT CONNECTS FARMERS TOGETHER THROUGH A DIGITAL FORUM.

2.THE APPLICATION WILL BE MULTILINGUAL.THAT IS,PEOPLE CAN CHOOSE TO ANSWER IN THE LANGUAGE OF THIER CHOICE.THIS CAN THEN BE CONVERTED INTO THE QUESTIONER'S PREFERRED LANGUAGE.

3. THE ANSWERS CAN THEN BE VOTED UPON IF THEY WERE FOUND TO BE USEFUL OR NOT.

4.WITH COOPERATION FROM THE GOVERMENT,WE WILL BE COLLECTING AGRICULTURAL PATTERNS PERTAINING TO LAND BEING USED FOR CROPS.THIS WILL THEN REVEAL WHICH IS THE BEST SUITED CROP FOR A RELATED AREA.WE WILL THEN PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION TO THE FARMERS.

5.OTHER THAN PROBLEM FORUM,WE WILL ALSO PROVIDE DAY TO DAY ALERT MESSAGES TO THE FARMERS GIVING THEM INFORMATION ABOUT WEATHER FORCASTS,CROP PRICES,UPCOMING SCHEMES ,LATEST TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES ETC.

6.WE WILL HAVE A SECTION RELATED TO THE LIST OF LOCAL BUYERS AVAILABLE IN THE USER'S REGION.
